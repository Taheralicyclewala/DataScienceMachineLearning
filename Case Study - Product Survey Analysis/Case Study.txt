Case Study:
-----------
The data file in the folder - product_test_data.csv, is the outcome of a product
entry survey done by a company to understand the quantities of the products used
by its customers. Each customer fills in the data automatically using their
inventory management system and the data dump is created at the close of the survey.

The main fields for the customer are Product, Amount and Entry_Date.
* Product: Is a pre-defined list of product names
* Amount: How much amount of the product is used in different applications
* Entry_Date: Date on which the product usage was entered into the system


Things to Note:
---------------
* Re-create the data file for each new day that you try working on the data as
  the current date is used for creating data
* The customers are expected to enter the amount of product (in grams) that is used for
  an application when it happens. So the "Amount" field will be a list of values.
* The survey duration is 90 days
* There are only 5 products - Product1, Product2, Product3, Product4 and Product5
* Total users are 50 with IDs between 1 and 50


Assumptions:
------------
* A survey always begins on the 1st day of the week
* The survey closes today and the start date is 90 days prior


To-Do:
------
Using a Jupyter notebook, find answers to the following questions:
1) List the top 10 customers who has the maximum usage of all products
2) List the top 3 users who has the most number of data entries for "Product1"
3) Which product has the maximum usage across all customers?
4) Find the weekly usage of each product across all users



Hint:
-----
* Data transformations would be required to find answers
* You can use Matplotlib or seaborn visualization package to showcase visualizations
