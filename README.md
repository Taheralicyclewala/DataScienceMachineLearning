# DataScienceMachineLearning
A collection of my notes and information that I came across while exploring Machine Learning and Data Science. This information is primarily targeted at my meetup group - Dublin Data Science Beginners. If you are in Dublin, I would like to extend an invitation to attend one of the meetup sessions. Good luck with your learning.
